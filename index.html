							<h2>About Me</h2>
							<p>An enthusiastic individual who is relentless and eager to gather, clean, & study datasets in order to come up with Data-Driven-Decisions to solve tasks for your company. Down below you will find highlights of my journey into Data Analytics as well as hobbies I enjoy outside of work. </p>
							<div class="features">

									<span class="icon solid major fa-code"></span>
									<h3>Self-Taught Learner</h3>
									<p> I hold a Google Data Analytics Professional Certification which gave me the foundational knowledge on becoming a Data Analyst. Understanding that this course would only provide me with basic knowledge for this field, I investigated further and found resources such as Udemy, Coursera, Youtube, W3 Schools, StrataScratch and many more to become proficient in tools such as Excel, SQL & Tableau. Learning these skills allowed me to feel more confident in my decision to become a Data Analyst.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-link"></span>
									<h3>Driven-By-Data</h3>
									<p>I wanted to change my life and when I got exposed to the world of Data Analytics, I quickly grew a passion for this career and started my research on what tools were required as well as what steps I needed to take in order to learn the skills so that I could break into this industry. I find great pride in becoming disciplined, self-driven and determined during my path to becoming a Data Analyst. This is not an easy road, but it sure is fulfilling when you accomplish something that is solely reliant on the decisions you make with the time you have on a daily basis.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-gem"></span>
									<h3>Gamer At Heart</h3>
									<p>On a less serious note, I love to game. I find enjoyment from many different types of games ranging from sports to a classic FPS(first-person-shooter). I find that gaming sharpens my analytical skills because depending on the type of game, you are always put in a situation where you have to assess the environment and make decisions based off the data you acquired as you progress through the game. Apparently I've been a Data Analyst my whole life. Who knew? </p>

									<span class="icon solid major fa-desktop"></span>
									<h3>Sports Is Life</h3>
									<p>As long as I can remember, sports has been a big part of my life in some shape or form. The enjoyment and memories I had playing football in high school, both on the team and outside of school, will forever hold a special place in my life. These days, I try to make the time to get some sort of athletic activity in, whether it just be tossing the football around or even playing a pickup basketball game. I have a passion for keeping up to date with all of the sports news, games and stats(DATA!!).</p>
